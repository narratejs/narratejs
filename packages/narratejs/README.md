    NarrateJS is a set of packages and functions that make it easy to drop in a fully functional article/blog system. Use any backend provider (eg. Supabase, MongoDB).
  </p>
    <p align="center">
    This is the NPM package which includes only the base system that can be imported into your project using npm install narratejs.

## Features

### All-In-One Drop-In Blog System

- Blog editor with basic CRUD operations
- Dynamic blog retreveal and rendering system based on Next.JS dynamic routing

### Backend Agnostic

We want the backend to be able to be swapped out with minimal disruption and code change. We anticipate many "modules" that will connect various backend systems to NarrateJS.

The first release will include support for Supabase only. Once the system is in place we will focus on creating more modules for other systems.

### TypeScript Support

NarrateJS libraries are written with type safety in mind. [Check out the docs](https://www.narratejs.com/getting-started/typescript) for more information.
